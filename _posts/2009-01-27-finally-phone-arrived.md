After more than a month, my Freerunner has arrived! There were some issues with DHL, looks like my phone number was not set correctly and they were calling another person. So it went back to Taiwan and sent again to Barcelona. I can't wait to test it, try Evas there, develop for it, etc .... The past weeks i have only read, research and read again with no device to test or develop to, finally i can start coding :) Great times will come!
