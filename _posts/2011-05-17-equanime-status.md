The [Equanime](http://code.google.com/p/equanime/) project right now is idle but not dead. I still want to finish that project but given the limited time I have I need to prioritize on what project I put all my effort and resources. That's why the [Enesim](http://code.google.com/p/enesim) framework is getting all my attention this days, once the toolkit library is done, it will be a good moment to retake the Equanime development given that then we can start drawing things on the target devices of Equanime. Even so I've created a [group](http://groups.google.com/group/equanime-devel) for discussing the development of the project.
