Hi all, as some of you already know, I was [hacking](http://open.neurostechnology.com/content/turrans-kernel-porting-project-standard-linux-api-all) the Neuros OSD device some time ago, doing a kernel porting project using standard Linux API for some functional blocks, such as V4L, FB, etc. After some negotiations I [officially](http://open.neurostechnology.com/content/welcome-turran) work for Neuros Technologies now, focusing mainly on low level stuff and multimedia for the next generation Neuros OSD2 =)
