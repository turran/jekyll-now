Finally I've changed the server where my previous (and nonfunctional) web page was (thanks Hisham!). The only problem is that I couldn't import my previous posts, the Typo version was exactly the same but for some reason it didn't work out and honestly I don't have time to learn, hack or fix Typo for this.
