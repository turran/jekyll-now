A few weeks ago i bought a gp2x portable console, I was interested on this device because it has Linux as operating system and also because there's a large [community](http://wiki.gp2x.org) behind it. I have several plans with it and Enlightenmnent (mainly the EFL); but before that, the first step i should do is to port the linux 2.6.x to it. I've just registered a new [Google Code's project](http://code.google.com/p/gp2x-linux26) but I'm having issues with it, don't know if it's better to register with SourceForge. There will be several news soon ....
