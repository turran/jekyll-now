After talking to the guys behind Google's code they have increased the [project](http://code.google.com/p/gp2x-linux26/) size and now I can code fine there. The kernel boots correctly but there are too may things to code, but hopefully this is a start. There hasn't been too much enthusiasm on the GP2X community as i thought at the beginning with this project, in any case this helped me to get started on the ARM architecture and learn how to port a a new SoC into the Linux Kernel
